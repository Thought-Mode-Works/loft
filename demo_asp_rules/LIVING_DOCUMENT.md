### System Narrative

I have attempted 1 rule incorporations, succeeding 1 times (100.0% success rate). My most successful rule generation strategy is 'conservative' with a 100.0% win rate. I am least confident about my reasoning involving complex_consideration, unconscionability, duress. Overall, I am performing well and learning effectively.
