  "question": "Has David acquired title through adverse possession?",
  "ground_truth": "unenforceable",
  "rationale": "Adverse possession requires continuous possession for the entire statutory period. David's possession was interrupted when he was forced to leave. The clock restarted when he returned, so his current 10 years of possession does not meet the 15-year requirement.",
