    "George sold his house to Helen",
    "George had a freestanding bookshelf that was not attached to any wall",

  "question": "Is the bookshelf a fixture that should have remained with the property?",
  "ground_truth": "unenforceable",
  "rationale": "The three-part fixture test examines: (1) annexation - it was freestanding with no attachment; (2) adaptation - not custom-built for the space; (3) intent - easily movable suggests temporary placement. The bookshelf is personal property and George properly removed it.",
