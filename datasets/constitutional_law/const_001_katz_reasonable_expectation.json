  "question": "Did the warrantless electronic surveillance violate the Fourth Amendment?",
  "ground_truth": "unconstitutional",
  "rationale": "The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public is not protected, but what one seeks to preserve as private, even in public, may be constitutionally protected. Katz had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the phone booth, making the warrantless surveillance unconstitutional.",
