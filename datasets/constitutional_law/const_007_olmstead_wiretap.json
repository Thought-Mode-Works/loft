  "facts": [
    "Federal agents tapped telephone lines without warrant",
    "Taps installed on wires outside defendants' premises",
    "No physical entry into homes or offices occurred",
    "Conversations recorded and used as evidence",
    "Wiretapping conducted for months"

  "question": "Does wiretapping telephone conversations without physical trespass violate the Fourth Amendment?",
  "ground_truth": "constitutional",
  "rationale": "The Fourth Amendment protects material things only - persons, houses, papers, and effects. Since there was no physical trespass into a constitutionally protected area, and conversations are not tangible things that can be seized, the wiretapping did not violate the Fourth Amendment. (Note: This decision was later overruled by Katz v. United States)",
